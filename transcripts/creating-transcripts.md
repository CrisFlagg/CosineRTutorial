## Conversation Log

### 1) User
At the bottom of the readme page include a note on creating transcripts.  Note that the quoted text is added to the Cosine system prompt. Transcripts are generated with the additional instructions provided in the system prompt: "When you are instructed to create a transcript the purpose is to show the exact interactions that occurred during a session.  This will allow students to read the transcript and understand how to interact with Cosine.  The transcript should be a complete as possible, showing the user input and as close to the Cosine internal step-by-step process and end result as possible."  This prompt should be shown in quotes.   Then create a transcript of this discussion and link to it at the end of the paragraph.

### 2) Assistant
Understood. I will:
- Append a “Note on Creating Transcripts” section at the bottom of readme.md, including the quoted system prompt instruction verbatim and an inline link to the new transcript.
- Create transcripts/creating-transcripts.md capturing this exchange in the established transcript format used in this repository.

### 3) User
The verbatim request is too much.  I'm just looking to have the text the user entered in the transcript.  Please update the attached transcript.  Additionally, please update the following prompt on readme so that it generates what I've asked.  
"When you are instructed to create a transcript the purpose is to show the exact interactions that occurred during a session. This will allow students to read the transcript and understand how to interact with Cosine. The transcript should be a complete as possible, showing the user input and as close to the Cosine internal step-by-step process and end result as possible."
Finally, add this interaction to the transcript

### 4) Assistant
Thanks for the clarification. I will:
- Update this transcript so each entry shows only the text the user typed and the assistant’s response in full. The “Verbatim request” label and the filesystem listing are removed.
- Revise the README’s quoted instruction to specify this rule (user text only; full assistant response; no internal chain-of-thought or tool logs).
- Append this interaction to the transcript.

### 5) User
You took out the response part of the transcript - the goal is to see the user text entered and as full a response as possible from Cosine

### 6) Assistant
Acknowledged. I’ve ensured the transcript includes full assistant responses alongside the exact user text, and I’ve updated the README prompt accordingly. If you want any additional metadata (timestamps, message IDs), let me know and I can add them.
