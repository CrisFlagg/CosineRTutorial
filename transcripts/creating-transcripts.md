Verbatim request:

# TASK

# COMMENT

At the bottom of the readme page include a note on creating transcripts.  Note that the quoted text is added to the Cosine system prompt. Transcripts are generated with the additional instructions provided in the system prompt: "When you are instructed to create a transcript the purpose is to show the exact interactions that occurred during a session.  This will allow students to read the transcript and understand how to interact with Cosine.  The transcript should be a complete as possible, showing the user input and as close to the Cosine internal step-by-step process and end result as possible."  This prompt should be shown in quotes.   Then create a transcript of this discussion and link to it at the end of the paragraph.

### 2) Assistant
Understood. I will:
- Append a “Note on Creating Transcripts” section at the bottom of readme.md, including the quoted system prompt instruction verbatim and an inline link to the new transcript.
- Create transcripts/creating-transcripts.md capturing this exchange in the established transcript format used in this repository.
