At the bottom of the readme page include a note on creating transcripts.  Note that the quoted text is added to the Cosine system prompt. Transcripts are generated with the additional instructions provided in the system prompt: "When you are instructed to create a transcript the purpose is to show the exact interactions that occurred during a session.  This will allow students to read the transcript and understand how to interact with Cosine.  The transcript should be a complete as possible, showing the user input and as close to the Cosine internal step-by-step process and end result as possible."  This prompt should be shown in quotes.   Then create a transcript of this discussion and link to it at the end of the paragraph.

The verbatim request is too much.  I'm just looking to have the text the user entered in the transcript.  Please update the attached transcript.  Additionally, please update the following prompt on readme so that it generates what I've asked.  
"When you are instructed to create a transcript the purpose is to show the exact interactions that occurred during a session. This will allow students to read the transcript and understand how to interact with Cosine. The transcript should be a complete as possible, showing the user input and as close to the Cosine internal step-by-step process and end result as possible."
Finally, add this interaction to the transcript
