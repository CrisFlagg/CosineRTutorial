## Conversation Log

### 1) User
“what is this pull request thing I see Cosine making?  I've done things but I don't see it in my repsitory?  Please give me a walkthrough on how to get code I update with cosine to my repository so I can use it.”

### 2) Assistant
Short answer: Cosine is proposing changes in a Pull Request (PR). Those changes live on a separate branch until you merge the PR. You won’t see them in your repo’s main branch (or on your computer) until you merge on GitHub and then Pull to your machine.

What a Pull Request is (in plain terms)
- A PR is a “proposal” to change your repo.
- The work sits on a branch so your main stays stable.
- You review → click Merge → main updates → then you Pull locally.

How to get Cosine’s changes into your repo (and onto your computer)
1) Find the PR: On github.com → your repo → Pull requests tab → open the PR.
2) Review (optional): Click Files changed to see diffs. To try locally:
   - GitHub Desktop: Open with GitHub Desktop on the PR page, or choose the PR branch from “Current Branch”, then Pull.
   - Command line: `git fetch` then `git checkout <pr-branch>`.
3) Merge on GitHub: Click “Merge pull request” → Confirm.
4) Update your local copy:
   - GitHub Desktop: Switch to main → Pull origin.
   - RStudio: Git tab → Pull.
   - CLI: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`.

If Merge is disabled
- Required checks failing: Click “Details” to see failures.
- Merge conflicts: Click “Resolve conflicts” or ask me to resolve.
- Permissions: A repo admin may need to merge.

Why you didn’t see changes in your repository
- The PR isn’t merged yet.
- You’re on main but the work is on the PR branch.
- You merged, but haven’t pulled locally.

Quick checklist
1) Open PR on GitHub.
2) Optional: test locally.
3) Merge.
4) Pull to your computer.

### 3) User
“can you give me some links to git or github that will explain things like pr and branch?  I am fairly new to this.”

3) Print the cheat sheet.
4) 10–15 mins on Learn Git Branching.

### 7) User
“please add this to the appropriate place in the readme page and create a transcript”

### 8) Assistant
Added a new “Git and GitHub for R users” section to the README with a link to a transcript file. Initially created the transcript as a resource list.

### 9) User
“the transcript is incorrect.  It should be a transcript of our conversation, like the other transcripts in that folder.”

### 10) Assistant
Acknowledged and updated this file to contain the full conversation log in the same style as the other transcripts. The README link remains valid.

### 11) User
"now - use the data you pulled to create a top level 'github for r' tutorial page, link the page from the readme, and update his transcript file."

### 12) Assistant
Created a top-level tutorial page (github-for-r.md), linked it from the README, and updated this transcript to reference the new page.

### 13) User
"put transcript and tutorial on seperate lines. Add the recent conversation to the transcript"

### 14) Assistant
Ensured the README shows the tutorial and transcript on separate lines (now as bullet points), and appended this recent exchange to the transcript.

### 15) User
"These are still on the same lines.  Put a line break or bullets or something.  Update the conversation when you are done and include the image I pasted"

### 16) Assistant
Updated the README to display:
- Tutorial: GitHub for R – step-by-step tutorial
- Transcript: Git and GitHub for R users – conversation transcript

Also appended this step to the transcript and embedded the user-provided screenshot below for context.
