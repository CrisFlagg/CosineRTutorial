## Conversation Log

### 1) User
Since we're using R for the analysis should I use R for the visualizations or is there another package that you would recommend? I'm looking for cosine to write this I'd also like an explanation of what is possible.

### 2) Assistant
Short answer: stay in R for visuals. You already have an R workflow, renv, ggplot2, and a Shiny app scaffold. R covers the full spectrum—publication‑grade static plots, interactive web graphics, dashboards, animations, and report automation—without switching stacks.

What’s possible in R (and when to use it)
- Static, publication‑quality figures
  - ggplot2: the workhorse for layered, consistent charts
  - patchwork/cowplot: arrange multi‑panel figures
  - scales, ggsci/viridis: formatting and color palettes
  - ragg/svglite: crisp PNG/PDF/SVG export
  - When: papers, slides, PDFs, journals, print
- Interactive charts and dashboards
  - plotly (via ggplotly or native), echarts4r, highcharter, ggiraph
  - Shiny for fully interactive apps and filtering, or Quarto HTML reports for shareable pages
  - When: exploratory analysis, stakeholders who want tooltips/zoom/filter, web delivery
- Animations
  - gganimate (+ gifski/av): show changes over time or states
  - When: explain a process, time evolution, presentations
- Specialized
  - leaflet/mapview/sf: interactive maps
  - ggraph/igraph: networks
  - rayshader/plotly: 3D surfaces
- Reproducible reporting
  - Quarto/R Markdown: one‑click HTML/PDF/Word reports that run analyses and build plots

Recommended stack for this repo
- Keep ggplot2 as the core
- Add (Suggests) as needed:
  - patchwork (plot layouts)
  - plotly (interactivity)
  - gganimate + gifski (animations, optional)
  - viridis (accessible colors)
- For dashboards, extend your existing Shiny app or ship a Quarto HTML report for shareable interactive docs

Quick examples against your project outputs
1) Static chart (publication-ready) using ggplot2
```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
})

# Left-stride mean distribution (gaitpdb) — PD vs Control
p <- readr::read_csv("outputs/gaitpdb/characterization_trials.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  filter(group %in% c("pd", "control"), !is.na(left_stride_mean_s)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(left_stride_mean_s, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.6, bins = 30, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "gaitpdb: Left stride mean (s) by group",
    x = "Left stride mean (s)", y = "Count", fill = "Group"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

dir.create("outputs/gaitpdb/plots_pub", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
ggplot2::ggsave("outputs/gaitpdb/plots_pub/left_stride_mean_hist.pdf", p, width = 7, height = 5, device = cairo_pdf)
ggplot2::ggsave("outputs/gaitpdb/plots_pub/left_stride_mean_hist.png", p, width = 7, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

2) Make it interactive with plotly (no re‑authoring)
```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse); library(plotly)
})

df <- readr::read_csv("outputs/gaitpdb/characterization_trials.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  filter(group %in% c("pd", "control"), !is.na(left_stride_mean_s))

p <- ggplot(df, aes(left_stride_mean_s, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.6, bins = 30, color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() + labs(x = "Left stride mean (s)", y = "Count", fill = "Group")

ggplotly(p, tooltip = c("x", "fill"))
```

3) Minimal Shiny explorer for both datasets (single file you can run)
```r
# Run with: shiny::runApp(list(ui = ui, server = server))
library(shiny); library(tidyverse); library(plotly)

load_dataset <- function(which) {
  if (which == "gaitpdb") {
    path <- "outputs/gaitpdb/characterization_trials.csv"
    if (!file.exists(path)) return(NULL)
    readr::read_csv(path, show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
      mutate(dataset = "gaitpdb")
  } else {
    path <- "outputs/gaitndd/characterization_records.csv"
    if (!file.exists(path)) return(NULL)
    readr::read_csv(path, show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
      mutate(dataset = "gaitndd")
  }
}

metrics <- c(
  "Left stride mean (gaitpdb)" = "left_stride_mean_s",
  "Right stride mean (gaitpdb)" = "right_stride_mean_s",
  "Left stride CV% (gaitpdb)" = "left_stride_cv_pct",
  "Right stride CV% (gaitpdb)" = "right_stride_cv_pct",
  "Left stride mean (gaitndd)" = "l_stride_mean_s",
  "Right stride mean (gaitndd)" = "r_stride_mean_s",
  "Double support % (gaitndd)" = "ds_mean_pct"
)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Gait datasets explorer"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("dataset", "Dataset", choices = c("gaitpdb", "gaitndd")),
      selectInput("metric", "Metric", choices = metrics),
      checkboxInput("by_group", "Color by group (PD vs Control where available)", TRUE)
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotlyOutput("hist"),
      tableOutput("head")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  dat <- reactive({
    load_dataset(input$dataset)
  })

  output$hist <- renderPlotly({
    d <- dat()
    validate(need(!is.null(d), "Please run the characterization scripts first to produce outputs/ CSVs."))

    xvar <- input$metric
    has_group <- "group" %in% names(d) && input$by_group
    p <- ggplot(d, aes(x = .data[[xvar]], fill = if (has_group) .data$group else NULL)) +
      geom_histogram(position = if (has_group) "identity" else "stack", alpha = if (has_group) 0.6 else 0.8, bins = 30, color = "white") +
      labs(x = xvar, y = "Count", fill = if (has_group) "Group" else NULL) +
      theme_minimal()
    ggplotly(p, tooltip = if (has_group) c("x", "fill") else "x")
  })

  output$head <- renderTable({
    head(dat() %>% select(1:8), 10)
  })
}
```

4) Optional: an animation (example pattern)
```r
# install.packages(c("gganimate","gifski"))
library(tidyverse); library(ggplot2); library(gganimate)

df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(300),
  group = rep(c("control","pd","als"), each = 100)
)

p <- ggplot(df, aes(x, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, alpha = 0.7, position = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  transition_states(group, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution by group: {closest_state}")

anim_save("outputs/anim_hist.gif", animate(p, renderer = gifski_renderer(), width = 700, height = 500, fps = 20))
```

When you might consider non‑R options
- You don’t have to. R already hits every requirement above.
- Consider Python only if your team is standardized on a Python viz stack and you expect to reuse those components elsewhere.

Proposed integration plan (I can implement this for you)
- A project‑wide plotting theme and palette
- A visualization script “gallery”
- An interactive explorer
- A reproducible report

Would you like me to add these to the repo now?

### 3) User
Can you give me an overview of what I can use shiny for with respect to my data?

### 4) Assistant
Here’s what Shiny can do for your gait data, and how it fits your current repo.

What Shiny is good for in your project
- Exploratory analysis UI
- Trial browser and quality control
- Time‑series viewers (raw signal and derived series)
- Event‑detection parameter tuning (gaitpdb)
- Cross‑dataset harmonization
- Group comparisons and quick stats
- Model prototyping (lightweight)
- Reporting and exports

A practical Shiny structure for your repo
- Data layer
- UI modules (recommended)
- Interactivity and plotting
- Performance considerations
- Deployment options
- Reproducibility and governance

Concrete pages recommended
- Overview, Trial Browser, Time‑Series Viewer, Distributions and Group Compare, QC/Curation, Feature Correlation, (Optional) Modeling

How this complements your current code
- Use characterization CSVs for cohort‑level views
- Drill into individual trials including raw signals
- Manage curation and QC thresholds without re‑running whole scripts
- Produce shareable summaries on demand

Would you like me to implement a first pass now?
- Option A (light): extend inst/app/app.R with plotly distributions, trial browser, and a basic raw viewer
- Option B (modules): new app with modularized pages

### 5) User
use plotly interactivity and include raw trial viewing.  implement the first pass Option A

### 6) Assistant
I’ve implemented Option A:

- Extended inst/app/app.R:
  - Distribution (plotly) panel
  - Trial browser (DT) with single-row selection
  - Raw trial viewer for gaitpdb with adjustable threshold and heel‑strike markers
  - Auto‑locates outputs/ and datasets/

- Updated dependencies:
  - DESCRIPTION Imports: plotly, dplyr, readr, DT
  - scripts/setup_renv.R: installs plotly and DT

How to run:
- Rscript scripts/setup_renv.R
- Launch:
  - R -e "shiny::runApp('inst/app')"  OR
  - R -e "devtools::load_all(); cosineR::run_app()"

### 7) User
This is great!  add this to readme tutorials and create a very detailed transcript of this conversation.  I want the transcript to be as close to this conversation as possible.  include links to the files you've created in the readme.

### 8) Assistant
Added a new “Shiny Gait Explorer (plotly + raw trial viewer)” tutorial to readme.md with links to inst/app/app.R, scripts/setup_renv.R, and DESCRIPTION. Created this transcript at transcripts/shiny-gait-explorer.md.

- DESCRIPTION (added plotly, dplyr, readr, DT to Imports)
- scripts/setup_renv.R (installs plotly and DT)
- readme.md (added “Shiny Gait Explorer” tutorial section with links)
- transcripts/shiny-gait-explorer.md (this transcript)

---

## How to Reproduce

1) Install dependencies with renv
- Rscript scripts/setup_renv.R

2) Ensure outputs exist (generate if needed)
- Rscript scripts/characterize_gaitpdb.R
- Rscript scripts/characterize_gaitndd.R

3) Launch the app
- R -e "shiny::runApp('inst/app')"    # direct
- R -e "devtools::load_all(); cosineR::run_app()"    # via helper

4) Use the panels
- Distribution: choose dataset/metric; adjust bins; optionally filter by group (if present)
- Trial browser: filter/select a row; selection drives the raw viewer (gaitpdb)
- Raw trial (gaitpdb): adjust threshold to align heel‑strike markers with force peaks
