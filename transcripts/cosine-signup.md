## Conversation Log

### 1) User
“How do I sign up for cosine? I am a student - does that get me a discount?”

### 2) Assistant
Here’s the quickest way to get started with Cosine and what to know about student pricing.

How to sign up
- Go to https://cosine.sh and click “Get started for free” (or go directly to https://ai.cosine.sh).
- Sign in with Google or GitHub (SSO).
- Once in, you can connect GitHub (and optionally Slack/Jira/Linear) when prompted.

Notes on pricing/trial
- The site advertises a free trial and month‑to‑month subscription afterward.
- Per the Terms, subscriptions renew monthly and refunds aren’t offered for past charges.

Student discounts
- There isn’t a publicly advertised student or education discount on Cosine’s site or docs right now.
- If you’re a student, it’s still worth asking—companies sometimes offer unlisted education pricing:
  - Use the chat bubble on https://ai.cosine.sh (bottom-right), or email support@cosine.sh (billing questions: billing@cosine.sh).
  - Mention your student status and include your .edu email or proof of enrollment.

“Would you like me to draft a short email you can send to support asking for student pricing?”

### 3) User
“I saw a linked post about discounts for 3 months of pro free - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yangli92_calling-all-students-ai-is-transforming-activity-7368658984188289025-JyKr?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAqxkYBImqyUvGnczWkP3jdpmuFpfGh0x4  Is this something you can access and if so what do I need to do to get the discount?”

### 4) Assistant
Short answer: I can’t access that LinkedIn post directly (LinkedIn blocks my browser), so I can’t verify the exact redemption steps from the post itself. But you can still get this handled quickly.

What to do now
1) Try the link in the post first
- Open the LinkedIn post while logged in and click the redemption link if there is one.
- Make sure the destination is a cosine.sh or ai.cosine.sh domain and sign in with Google/GitHub (ideally using your school email).
- If the link auto‑applies a promo, you should see confirmation in-app or via email.

2) If there’s no link (or it’s expired), contact Cosine to apply it manually
- Use the chat bubble on https://ai.cosine.sh (bottom-right), or email support@cosine.sh (billing questions: billing@cosine.sh).
- Reference: “Student promotion – 3 months Pro free from Yang Li’s LinkedIn post” and include:
  - Link to the LinkedIn post
  - Your Cosine account email and GitHub username
  - Your student email (.edu or equivalent)
  - Simple proof of enrollment (student ID or current enrollment letter/screenshot)
  - Ask them to apply the promo to your account, or as a credit if you already subscribed

3) Typical caveats to ask about
- New accounts only? Region restrictions? Personal use only/1 seat? Time window/expiry?
- If you’re already on a paid plan, ask for a pro‑rated account credit for the next 3 billing cycles.

Quick message templates
- Chat (ai.cosine.sh):
  “Hi Cosine team—I'm a student and saw Yang Li’s LinkedIn post offering 3 months of Pro free. Could you please apply this to my account? Cosine email: [your email], GitHub: [username], school: [school], proof attached. Post link: [paste LinkedIn URL]. Thanks!”

- Email to support@cosine.sh (subject: Student promo – 3 months Pro free)
  “Hello Cosine Support, I’m a student at [University] and saw Yang Li’s LinkedIn post offering 3 months of Pro free. I’d like to redeem it. My Cosine account email is [email], GitHub username is [username]. I’ve attached proof of enrollment and the post link: [URL]. If I’m already on a paid plan, could you apply it as a credit for the next three cycles? Thanks!”

“If you paste the text of the LinkedIn post (or a screenshot), I’ll extract the exact redemption link/code and walk you through it step‑by‑step. Would you like me to draft the email with your details now?”

### 5) User
“Add this as the first tutorial and create a transcript of our conversation 'cosine-signup.md'”

### 6) Assistant
Understood. I’ll create a transcript at transcripts/cosine-signup.md and add a new “first tutorial” entry in the README that links to it.

## Assistant Worklog (Concise, high-level)

- Looked up official Cosine entry points: cosine.sh (marketing) and ai.cosine.sh (login).
- Reviewed Cosine terms/docs to confirm monthly billing and lack of public student discount listing; gathered support touchpoints (support@cosine.sh, billing@cosine.sh, in‑app chat).
- Couldn’t load LinkedIn directly due to access restrictions; proposed two-track redemption path:
  - Follow the promo link if present and verified as cosine.sh/ai.cosine.sh.
  - Otherwise contact support with student verification and post URL.
- Provided ready‑to‑send chat and email templates.
- Created transcripts/cosine-signup.md (this document) and updated README to add this as the first tutorial linking here.
