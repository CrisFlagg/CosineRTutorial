Project now includes:
- R package scaffold (cosineR) with unit tests and CI
- Bundled Shiny app (inst/app/app.R) and helper `run_app()`
- Example analysis script (scripts/analysis.R)
- renv setup script for reproducible environments

## Quick start

1) Initialize renv and install deps
- From the project root, run:
  - Rscript scripts/setup_renv.R

2) Run the example analysis
- Rscript scripts/analysis.R
- Outputs are written to:
  - outputs/summary.csv
  - outputs/plot.png

3) Run the Shiny app
- Option A (direct):
  - R -e "shiny::runApp('inst/app')"
- Option B (via package helper):
  - R -e "devtools::load_all(); cosineR::run_app()"

4) Develop and test the package
- Generate docs:
  - R -e "roxygen2::roxygenise()"
- Run tests:
  - R -e "devtools::test()"
- Install locally:
  - R -e "devtools::install_local()"

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) runs R CMD check on pushes and pull requests (main/master). It roxygenises docs before checking.

## Notes

- The package exports:
  - mean_sd(): utility returning mean and sd for a numeric vector
  - run_app(): launches the bundled Shiny app
- .Rprofile auto-activates renv when present.
- Edit DESCRIPTION to update package metadata (name, author, URLs) as needed.
